# Command Line Questions

1.  Without using jargon, how would you describe the command line to a lay person (e.g. your mum)?

The command-line is a method for interacting with your computer that pre-dates the metaphor of a desktop or (graphical user interface).  You work almost entirely through text, using commands and other tricks of language to accomplish your wants.  As such, the command line feels like a conversation with the machine.  By using the command line, you feel tied to a deeper history of computing,  have a much different way of perceiving files and directories, and have a better idea of all the awesome things you and the computer can do together.


2. List 10 terminal commands and in plain english (i.e. with minimal technical jargon) describe what they do

* pwd - tell me my 'present working directory' (the directory I am in right now.)
* ls - list the visible contents of a directory. If I don't give a specific one to list, it'll list my present working directory.
* mkdir - make a directory.  If I don't provide a path of where the directory should live, it will be created in my  pwd
* cd - change directory.  If I don't say where I want to change directories to, it'll take me home.
* vim - run the text editor vim.  If I include a file with the command, it will open the file _with_ vim, so I can use the text editor to modify the file.
* rm - remove a file.
* man - open the manual page for a command, so I can learn more about it and it's various flags. It's the best command.
* chmod - change the permissions of a file or directory (who can read it, write it, or execute it as a program)
* mv - move a file.  If I move it to a newly named file, that does not exist, it acts closer to 'renaming'
* ssh - Creates a tunnel from one computer or server to another, through a 'secure shell'.  Useful for logging into a web server.
